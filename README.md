# ZIP Code Map App (Mock Implementation)

This Flutter application provides a mock implementation for demonstration purposes, showcasing the potential functionality for real-world scenarios. Currently, it utilizes hardcoded ZIP code boundaries and OpenStreetMap tiles for visualization on the map. However, this implementation can be easily replaced with dynamic data fetching from APIs to obtain accurate ZIP code coordinates and boundary information. Additionally, future enhancements could include features such as entering a ZIP code to automatically fetch and display the corresponding area, thereby providing a more interactive and dynamic user experience.

## Features

- Display a map interface with selectable ZIP codes
- Users can choose a ZIP code from a dropdown menu
- Selected ZIP code boundaries are displayed on the map
- Ability for users to draw polygons on the map to define custom areas of interest by tapping anywhere on the map
