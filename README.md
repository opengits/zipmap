# Zip Map

Zip Map is a Flutter application for visualizing zip code boundaries on an interactive map using GeoJSON data.

## Description

Zip Map provides a convenient way to visualize zip code boundaries on an interactive map. The app fetches GeoJSON data representing zip code areas and renders them as polygons on the map. Users can explore different zip code areas and get a visual understanding of their boundaries.
